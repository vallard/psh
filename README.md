# Parallel Shell

Execute SSH to multiple machines

## History

This is a port of a very good parallel shell we used in xCAT
for Linux clusters.  I had the need with multiple machines to 
use it on a workstation node for various system administration
tasks. 

The original xCAT code was written by Jarrod Johnson and Egan Ford.
The source can be seen [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/xcat/xcat-core/ci/master/tree/xCAT-client/bin/psh)
and [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/xcat/xcat-core/ci/master/tree/perl-xCAT/xCAT/NodeRange.pm)
